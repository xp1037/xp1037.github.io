I am an M.S. student in **Materials Science and Engineering** at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).  
My research focuses on:

- **Quantum embedding methods (DMET, SEET)** for periodic strongly correlated systems  
- **High-accuracy quantum chemistry** (MP2, CCSD(T)) for extended solids and catalysts  
- **Machine learning** for energy prediction and electronic-structure modeling  
- Applications to **Fe–N–C catalysts**, **RuO₂ OER**, and **degenerate MoS₂ transistors**

I am actively seeking a **Ph.D. position (2026 Fall)** in Computational Chemistry / Materials Science.
