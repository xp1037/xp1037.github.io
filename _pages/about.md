Hi there! I’m Qifan Yang.I am currently a third-year Master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by Prof. [Tianyou Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2q4RzdsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Yinghe Zhao](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2331-8973).

My primary research interest lies in developing quantum embedding frameworks and high-accuracy correlated methods for catalytic materials. In particular, I build periodic Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) methods that enable local CCSD(T)-level electronic-structure calculations for periodic systems. In the future, I intend to extend this line of research by bridging quantum many-body theory with machine-learning-assisted modeling to achieve accurate and scalable simulations for complex materials systems.

I am actively seeking a **Ph.D. position (2026 Fall)** in Computational Chemistry / Materials Science.
