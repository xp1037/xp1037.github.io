## Featured repository: [pyemb_calc](https://github.com/xp1037/pyemb_calc)

A lightweight, open-source  quantum chemistry framework built upon PySCF, integrating several quantum embedding theory approaches for periodic systems. It enables high-level post-Hartree–Fock calculations such as CCSD(T) for periodic structures, supporting both full-system and localized embedding computations.

### Highlights
- Periodic Hartree–Fock / DFT / MP2 / CCSD(T) calculations using PySCF-PBC.
- bDirect embedding schemes (DMET-like) for localized correlation treatment.
- Automatic structure, basis, and configuration parsing.
