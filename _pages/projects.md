## Featured repository: [pyemb_calc](https://github.com/xp1037/pyemb_calc)

A lightweight, open-source toolkit for exploring embedding-based calculations in Python. The project is built to make it easy to prototype new workflows, inspect intermediates, and adapt the core routines to different research questions.

### Highlights
- Clear Python-first implementation that keeps the learning curve shallow for newcomers.
- Modular building blocks so you can reuse parsers, solvers, and analysis helpers without carrying extra baggage.
- Example-driven documentation to help you connect theoretical ideas with runnable code.

### Get started
1. Clone the repository and create a fresh virtual environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xp1037/pyemb_calc.git
   cd pyemb_calc
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the package in editable mode so local tweaks take effect immediately:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Explore the included examples and notebooks to see typical workflows, then tailor the scripts to your own systems.
